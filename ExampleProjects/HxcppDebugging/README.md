This project is a working demonstration of how to set up a project to use the 
hxcpp-debugger with an OpenFL target on Windows.  It was set up following the 
instructions at http://intellij-logtalk.org/debugging.  Note that version 2018.1
of IntelliJ IDEA was used.  It may not work with earlier versions.

Requirements:
1) hxcpp haxelib version 3,4,188 installed.  (No particular reason for this 
version.  You simply have to update the dependencies on the module if you 
decide to use a different one.)

2) hxcpp-debugger protocol_v1.1 branch from a git repo.

To use:

You can use this directory in place, but we recommend copying the entire 
directory to another source tree so that you can experiment without getting 
git confused.
